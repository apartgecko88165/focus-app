# "Focus App" by Finn B.

A simple command line application to set timers to help with focusing on tasks.

This is a personal project to improve my productivity.

### Getting Started:

_Note: This is designed on_ `Python 3.12.5`, _and may not support previous versions. If you don't have_ `python3` _installed already, it is required to run this program. Once installed you can run_ `python --version ` _or_ `python3 --version` _to check if you are on the recommended version._

1. Download the zip archive.
2. Extract the files into a directory of your choice.
3. Add the install location to PATH.

_**That's it!**_
Run `focus` in the terminal/command line to begin.
